# manual_exception_handling
 this handles exceptions inside the module its specified to manage without needing previous handlers for the exception
	a good use case would be using this inside a manually mapped module
	
# This is a fork of @lennyRBLX manual-exception-handling Repository  
   

  If I recall correctly all I did was fix some annoying outdated includes and calls for The Windows SDK (10.0.26100) to work, and a few lines I edited to integrate the codebase into one of my libraries. 
  
  But since the repo is archived and I don't use it anymore I might aswell release it again with my changes, I tried my best to make the project standalone again.
